## Classification Rules Management

### Adding New Rules

4. Save the rule

### Rule Priority

- First matching rule is applied
- Use specific rules before general ones

### Best Practices
- Use exact source/medium combinations
- Group similar sources under consistent channel types
- Regularly review and update classifications
- Test new rules with sample data

## Database Schema

### ChannelClassification Model
```python
class ChannelClassification(models.Model):
    source = models.CharField(max_length=255)           # Traffic source
    medium = models.CharField(max_length=255)           # Traffic medium
    source_medium = models.CharField(max_length=255)    # Combined source/medium
    channel = models.CharField(max_length=255)          # Channel name
    channel_type = models.CharField(max_length=50)      # Channel category
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)       # Rule status
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
```

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py makemigrations woocommerce
python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. Populate Default Classifications
```bash
python manage.py populate_channel_classifications
```

### 3. Verify Configuration
- Check Django admin for ChannelClassification entries
- Verify API endpoints are accessible
- Test frontend integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Data Available
- Check if WooCommerce orders exist in the database
- Verify classification rules are active
- Check API endpoint connectivity

#### Missing Channel Types
- Ensure classification rules cover all traffic sources
- Check for typos in source/medium combinations
- Verify rules are marked as active

#### API Errors
- Check Django backend is running
- Verify database migrations are applied
- Check authentication and permissions

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check classification rules
python manage.py shell
from woocommerce.models import ChannelClassification
ChannelClassification.objects.all().count()

# Test API endpoint
curl http://localhost:8001/api/woocommerce/orders/channels_report/?period=30
```
