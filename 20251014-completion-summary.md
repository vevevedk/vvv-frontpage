## 🔄 Integration Status

### ✅ Ready to Use (No Additional Setup)
- All UI components
- Error boundary
- Design tokens
- Enhanced deployment script
- Documentation

### ⏳ Requires Node.js Upgrade (for SWR)
- API caching with `lib/cache.ts`
- **Action Required**: Upgrade Node.js from 12.13.0 to >= 16.x
- **Command**: `nvm install 16 && nvm use 16` (if using nvm)
- **Then**: `npm install swr`

### 📝 Recommended Migrations
1. Update existing loading states to use `LoadingSpinner`
2. Replace alerts with Toast notifications
3. Add skeleton loaders to dashboard pages
4. Wrap critical components in ErrorBoundary
5. Migrate API calls to use SWR caching (after Node upgrade)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ Review all new components
2. ✅ Read IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
3. ⏳ Test local dev environment
4. ⏳ Upgrade Node.js to enable SWR

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Migrate high-traffic pages to use new components
2. Add Toast notifications to user actions
3. Test deployment script in staging
4. Update team on new patterns

### Medium-term (This Month)
1. Implement SWR caching across all API calls
2. Add E2E tests using new components
3. Set up error tracking (Sentry)
4. Monitor performance improvements
